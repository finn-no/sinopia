For instance, many projects depend on a selector library such as jQuery or Zepto but bundling or requiring a specific dependency means that those using a competing dependency will either need to include both or resort to something that uses their existing stack.\n\nUnopinionate looks for common libraries (e.g. jQuery, Zepto) that fill a specific roll (selector libraries).  Instead of depending on the library explicitly, depend on unopionate.js to deliver whatever library the user chooses.\n\n```javascript\nvar $ = unopinionate.selector;\n```\n\nUnopinionate works with CommonJS and AMD as well:\n\n```javascript\n//CommonJS\nvar $ = require('unopinionate').selector;\n\n//AMD (RequireJS)\nrequire([\n    'unopinionate'\n], function(unopinionate) {\n    var $ = unopinionate.selector;\n});\n```\n\nThis was inspired by the way Backbone.js handles selector libraries.\n\nSupported Libraries\n-------------------\n- selector\n    - jQuery\n    - Zepto\n    - Ender\n\n- template\n    - Mustache\n    - Handlebars\n\nMore to come...pull requests welcome.\n\n",
